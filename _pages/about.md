About me
------
I am an Assistant Professor (tenured) at the University of Twente (Netherlands), associated with the [Data management and Biometrics {_ext}](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/dmb/) group. Before, I was a postdoctoral research at the University of Groningen (Netherlands) in the [Intelligent Systems group](https://www.cs.rug.nl/is/), where I worked on the [H2020 TrimBot2020 project {_ext}](http://trimbot2020.webhosting.rug.nl/) to realize the first outdoor gardening robot. I obtained a PhD cum laude from the University of Groningen and the University of Salerno (Italy), and the BSc and MSc degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Salerno, both cum laude.

I am a General Co-chair of the series of international conferences on ["Applications of Intelligent Systems" {_ext}](http://appis.webhosting.rug.nl/2023/) (APPIS 2018, 2019, 2020, 2022, 2023).

Research
------
My research in Computer Vision and Machine Learning revolves around the problems of __generalization and robustness__ to changing environments and perturbations of the input data. I focus on __identifying and mitigating the sources of bias__ in training data, while __inducing good bias via expert and prior knowledge__ in the training process, model architectures or labels.

I address the understanding of the training data characteristics and the learning dynamics of computer vision models, to identify sources of bias and counteract them. I investigate the use of prior knowledge, in the form of improved labeling procedures to better exploit data semantics, in the design of novel architectural elements or to steer the learning process (e.g. via physics-informed models) for the training of data-efficient models, taking into account aspects related to training time and energy consumption. I envision efficient and robust computer vision models with embedded prior knowledge that are able to perform unbiased predictions, exploiting the semantics of the data rather than shortcut solutions, with reduced training time, size of the parameter space and energy consumption, with comparable performance to larger models trained with massive datasets and with higher computational requirements.
