About me
------
I am an Associate Professor at the University of Twente (Netherlands), with the [Data management and Biometrics](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/dmb/) group. Before, I was Assistant Professor at University of Twente and a postdoctoral research at the University of Groningen (Netherlands) in the [Intelligent Systems group](https://www.cs.rug.nl/is/), where I worked on the [H2020 TrimBot2020 project](http://trimbot2020.webhosting.rug.nl/) to realize the first outdoor gardening robot. I obtained a PhD cum laude from the University of Groningen and the University of Salerno (Italy), and the BSc and MSc degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Salerno, both cum laude. I have been General Co-chair of the series of international conferences on [Applications of Intelligent Systems](http://appis.webhosting.rug.nl/2023/) (APPIS 2018, 2019, 2020, 2022, 2023). \
I am currently Associate Editor for Pattern Recognition (Elsevier) and member of the Editorial Board of Neural Computing and Applications (Springer). I served as Area Chair for NeurIPS 2024. 

Research
------
My research in Computer Vision and Machine Learning revolves around the problems of __generalization and robustness__ to changing environments and perturbations of the input data. I focus on __identifying and mitigating the sources of bias__ in training data, while __inducing good bias via expert and prior knowledge__ in the training process, model architectures or labels.
